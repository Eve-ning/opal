Rhythm Game is a popular genre that utilizes music to challenge the players' sense of rhythm and visual pattern recognition.
Vertical Scrolling Rhythm Game (VSRG) , the most popular sub-genre, sees exponential growth in popularity in current years.
However, it faces a problem in predicting the difficulty of play due to its extremely complex nature.
In this proposal, I show how I plan to estimate this difficulty using DNNs and the possible use-cases.


Take for example in Figure~\ref{fig:finger_notation}, rapidly alternating the index and middle finger (2, 3) is simpler than alternating the ring and pinky (4, 5).
Imagine a note sequence with the same density, pressing (4, 5) in repeat will be immensely more difficult than (2, 3).

\subsection{Difficulty Estimation Proposal}\label{subsec:difficulty-estimation-proposal}

With advancing technologies in Machine Learning, I propose an alternative way using Deep Neural Networks to estimate difficulty.
We firstly encode note patterns as the input, and utilize online VSRG player performance databases~\cite{osu,quaver,etterna} to train on.

Finally, we will evaluate through prediction loss and deploy an online satisfaction survey on the performance in various VSRG communities.

In the next section, I proceed to outline key milestones in the project, detail procedures and ultimately justifying steps taken.
