A key make or break requirement in a large project is its project management.

We follow loosely the idea of Agile's methodology using an web-based planning tool, Jira.
Jira helps plan milestones, known as Agile Epics;
within milestones are user stories, use-cases told in a story.

In this project, we have 10 separate epics to be fulfilled.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cloud
    \item reamberPy Preparation
    \item Map Embedding
    \item Score Ground Truth
    \item Replay Ground Truth
    \item Streamlit Demo
    \item Research Report
    \item Neural Net Model
    \item Web API
    \item Scalability
\end{enumerate}

We discuss each in detail in the following sections.
However, we briefly tangent to the roadmap

\subsection{Roadmap}\label{subsec:roadmap}

We estimate the project to span from March 2022 to March 2023, as follows.

    \begin{tabular}{r|ll}
        & Start        & End          \\
        Cloud                 & 3 Mar 2022   & 1 Mar 2023   \\
        Score Ground Truth    & 11 Apr 2022  & 22 May 2022  \\
        reamberPy Preparation & 23 May 2022  & 19 June 2022 \\
        Map Embedding         & 20 June 2022 & 7 Aug 2022   \\
        Replay Ground Truth   & 8 Aug 2022   & 11 Sep 2022  \\
        Neural Net Model      & 12 Sep 2022  & 11 Dec 2022  \\
        Scalability           & 19 Sep 2022  & 27 Nov 2022  \\
        Web API               & 26 Sep 2022  & 30 Oct 2022  \\
        Streamlit Demo        & 31 Oct 2022  & 11 Dec 2022  \\
        Research Report       & 12 Dec 2022  & 1 Mar 2023
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Table of Epics and Estimated Timeline}
    \label{tab:epics}
\end{table}

We thus discuss each epic and their purposes
