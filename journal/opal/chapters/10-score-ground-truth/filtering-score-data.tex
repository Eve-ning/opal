After yielding the data, we need to filter away anomalies.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Remove maps not from osu!mania, that is, not a VSRG play
    \footnote{osu! has 4 different game modes, osu!mania is one of them}
    \item Remove "SV" maps, i.e.\ gimmicks that change difficulty of patterns
    \item Filter scores from 600K ~ 1M, anything below 600K is not representative of a "good play"
    \item Filter maps to only 4K and 7K. As keys except these have too little samples
\end{enumerate}
