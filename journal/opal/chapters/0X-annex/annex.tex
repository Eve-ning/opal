\section*{Annex}

I have been in the VSRG community for over 10 years and have tried difficulty estimation on-and-off as an amateur,
thus I have good faith in the success of this research.

There is already an ongoing unpaid community project for this, though in very early stages, utilizing manual algorithms instead of DNNs,
thus there will be additional acknowledgements outside of NTU.

I estimate that this project can be done within 1 year.
I can draft a timeline for this if this goes through.
